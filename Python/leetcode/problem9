Problem9: Check if number is palindrome

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

"""
Approach:
1. If number is negative return false
2. check if number is same as its reverse
3. In order to generate the reverse of number iterate until number!=0 and output = output*10+number%10 and number = number//10

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
